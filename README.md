# Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and Functional Annotation Pipeline
### UO in collaboration with InVivo Biosystems
### Authors: Tucker Bower, Kate Roth, Brendan Winnacott
### Mentors: Dr. Adam Saunders, Dr. Trisha Brock

## Project Summary

This pipeline utilizes *C. elegans* gene expression data to perform a network analysis of co-expressed genes and identify gene clusters (modules) significantly correlated with experimental treatments. This method evaluates changes in expression patterns with a higher, systems-level approach than traditional differential gene expression analysis. The genes, modules, and pathways identified in this analysis serve to inform and guide future research.
